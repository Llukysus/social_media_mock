    title: 'Wave-Particle Duality - The Most Mind-Bending Concept in Physics',
    content: 'Wave-particle duality is the concept that all matter and energy exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. Light behaves as both a wave AND a particle depending on how we observe it. This isn\'t just theory - it\'s the foundation of modern technology including lasers, LEDs, and solar panels!',

    title: 'Superposition Principle - Schrödinger\'s Cat Explained',
    content: 'The superposition principle states that a quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed. Think of Schrödinger\'s cat - it\'s both alive AND dead until you open the box. This is how quantum computers work, allowing them to process multiple possibilities at once!',

    title: 'Quantum Entanglement - Einstein\'s "Spooky Action at a Distance"',
    content: 'Quantum entanglement occurs when two particles become connected in such a way that measuring one instantly affects the other, no matter how far apart they are. Einstein called this "spooky action at a distance." This could revolutionize communication and cryptography!',

    title: 'Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle - Why Can\'t We Know Everything?',
    content: 'The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that you can\'t know both the position AND momentum of a particle with perfect accuracy. The more precisely you measure one, the less you know about the other. It\'s not a limitation of our instruments - it\'s a fundamental feature of quantum reality!',

    content: 'Quantum tunneling is when a particle passes through a barrier it should not cross in classical physics, thanks to its wave-like nature. This isn\'t science fiction - it powers flash memory, nuclear fusion in stars, and even helps explain how the sun shines!',

    title: 'Uncertainty Principle in Action - Real World Applications',
    content: 'The uncertainty principle means that for certain pairs of properties, like position and momentum, the more precisely you measure one, the less you can know about the other. This is not a flaw of instruments but a built-in feature of quantum reality. It affects everything from electron microscopes to quantum sensors!',

    title: 'Bloch Sphere Snapshot - Visualizing Qubit States',
    content: 'The Bloch sphere is a simple way to picture the state of a qubit as a point on a globe, where the poles are zero and one, and everything in between is a mix. It shows how qubits can smoothly shift between states, unlike rigid classical bits. This visualization is crucial for understanding quantum algorithms!',

    title: 'Quantum Gates in One Example - Hadamard Gate Explained',
    content: 'A quantum gate changes the state of a qubit, just like a classical logic gate changes bits, but with the ability to rotate or flip superpositions. For example, the Hadamard gate takes a qubit in zero and puts it into an equal mix of zero and one. This is the foundation of quantum computing!',

    content: 'Quantum advantage is the point where a quantum computer can solve a problem faster than any classical computer. This does not apply to every problem, but for certain tasks like factoring or simulating molecules, the difference can be enormous. We\'re getting closer every day!',
